# VPN Address Fixer

This is a small web-based tool for changing a device's fixed VPN address.

:warning: This tool only works for devices connected to a dedicated VPN server.

## Usage

Before you can use the tool, you will need to request an application id from IXON.

You can do so by contacting [IXON Support](https://support.ixon.cloud).

When you have an application id, you can paste it in the file by replacing (the first instance of) `<APPLICATION_ID_HERE>`.
