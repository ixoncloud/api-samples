# IXON demo


This app is developed with Nativescript & Angular so front-end developers can build mobile and web apps with the api from IXON.
Find more info about it on their websites [here](https://www.nativescript.org/nativescript-is-how-you-build-native-mobile-apps-with-angular).

You can use this app as an example to examine how the requests are made to the IXON api. So you can eventually implement the IXON api in you're own application.

## Note
To make use of this application you will need a account from IXON, find more info about it on the official [IXON website](https://www.ixon.cloud/).

And Before you can use the app, you will need to request an application id from IXON.

You can do so by contacting [IXON Support](https://www.ixon.cloud/contact).

When you got the application id, you need to set it in /src/app/_services/ixon.service.

These are just sample data
